        Parameters
        ----------
        thrustSource : int, float, callable, string, array
            Motor's thrust curve. Can be given as an int or float, in which
            case the thrust will be considered constant in time. It can
            also be given as a callable function, whose argument is time in
            seconds and returns the thrust supplied by the motor in the
            instant. If a string is given, it must point to a .csv or .eng file.
            The .csv file shall contain no headers and the first column must
            specify time in seconds, while the second column specifies thrust.
            Arrays may also be specified, following rules set by the class
            Function. See help(Function). Thrust units are Newtons.
        burnOut : int, float
            Motor burn out time in seconds.
        grainNumber : int
            Number of solid grains
        grainDensity : int, float
            Solid grain density in kg/m3.
        grainOuterRadius : int, float
            Solid grain outer radius in meters.
        grainInitialInnerRadius : int, float
            Solid grain initial inner radius in meters.
        grainInitialHeight : int, float
            Solid grain initial height in meters.
        oxidizerTankRadius :
            Oxidizer Tank inner radius.
        oxidizerTankHeight :
            Oxidizer Tank Height.
        oxidizerInitialPressure :
            Initial pressure of the oxidizer tank, could be equal to the pressure of the source cylinder in atm.
        oxidizerDensity :
            Oxidizer theoretical density in liquid state, for N2O is equal to 1.98 (Kg/m^3).
        oxidizerMolarMass :
            Oxidizer molar mass, for the N2O is equal to 44.01 (g/mol).
        oxidizerInitialVolume :
            Initial volume of oxidizer charged in the tank.
        distanceGrainToTank :
            Distance between the solid grain center of mass and the base of the oxidizer tank.
        injectorArea :
            injector outlet area.
        grainSeparation : int, float, optional
            Distance between grains, in meters. Default is 0.
        nozzleRadius : int, float, optional
            Motor's nozzle outlet radius in meters. Used to calculate Kn curve.
            Optional if the Kn curve is not interesting. Its value does not impact
            trajectory simulation.
        throatRadius : int, float, optional
            Motor's nozzle throat radius in meters. Its value has very low
            impact in trajectory simulation, only useful to analyze
            dynamic instabilities, therefore it is optional.
        reshapeThrustCurve : boolean, tuple, optional
            If False, the original thrust curve supplied is not altered. If a
            tuple is given, whose first parameter is a new burn out time and
            whose second parameter is a new total impulse in Ns, the thrust
            curve is reshaped to match the new specifications. May be useful
            for motors whose thrust curve shape is expected to remain similar
            in case the impulse and burn time varies slightly. Default is
            False.
        interpolationMethod : string, optional
            Method of interpolation to be used in case thrust curve is given
            by data set in .csv or .eng, or as an array. Options are 'spline'
            'akima' and 'linear'. Default is "linear".
