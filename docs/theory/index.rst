Welcome to RocketPy's theory documentation!
=========================================

The following documentations are complementary to the RocketPy's documentation.
They are intended to provide a more in-depth explanation of the theory behind RocketPy's code.
Also, it helps the contributors to documente the hypothesis and assumptions made 
in their code.
