Style Guide
===========

This page decribes code, documentation and git branching styles used throughout RocketPy's development.

Overview
--------

We mostly follow the standard Python style conventions as described here:
 * `Style Guide for Python Code <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>`_
 * `Docstring Conventions <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/>`_

Our docstring styles are greatly influenced by NumPy:
 * `NnumPyDoc Style Guide <https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html>`_
